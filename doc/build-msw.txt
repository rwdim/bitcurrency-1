WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
===================

This build system is just like all the other build systems for this kind of
wallet, and uses Linux to build for everything except Mac OSX.

To build in linux, you'll need Ubuntu 16.04 or newer 64-bit with at least 4GB of
RAM and 2GB of disk space.

Compilers Supported
-------------------
g++-mingw-w64-i686
g++-mingw-w64-x86-64
gcc-mingw-w64-i686 is
gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 is

Note: releases are cross-compiled using mingw running on Linux.


Dependencies
------------
Libraries you need to download separately and build:

None. All the libraries are built inside MinGW for you when you run the build
script.

That said, the libraries we specifically use are all located in the depends folder:

OpenSSL 1.0.1f
Berkeley DB 4.8.30.NC 	(Non-Crypto version)	   
Boost 1.60.1		\boost-1.47.0-mgw          
miniupnpc       	\miniupnpc-1.8-mgw         

Their licenses:
OpenSSL        Old BSD license with the problematic advertising requirement
Berkeley DB    New BSD license with additional requirement that linked software must be free open source
Boost          MIT-like license
miniupnpc      New (3-clause) BSD license

Versions used in this release:
OpenSSL      1.0.1f
Berkeley DB  4.8.40.NC
Boost        1.65.1
miniupnpc    1.9


OpenSSL
-------
MSYS shell:
un-tar sources with MSYS 'tar xfz' to avoid issue with symlinks (OpenSSL ticket 2377)
change 'MAKE' env. variable from 'C:\MinGW32\bin\mingw32-make.exe' to '/c/MinGW32/bin/mingw32-make.exe'

cd /c/openssl-1.0.1b-mgw
./config
make

Berkeley DB
-----------
MSYS shell:
cd /c/db-4.8.30.NC-mgw/build_unix
sh ../dist/configure --enable-mingw --enable-cxx
make

Boost
-----
DOS prompt:
downloaded boost jam 3.1.18
cd \boost-1.47.0-mgw
bjam toolset=gcc --build-type=complete stage

MiniUPnPc
---------
UPnP support is optional, make with USE_UPNP= to disable it.

MSYS shell:
cd /c/miniupnpc-1.6-mgw
make -f Makefile.mingw
mkdir miniupnpc
cp *.h miniupnpc/

BitCurrency
-------
DOS prompt:
cd \bitcurrency\src
mingw32-make -f makefile.mingw
strip bitcurrencyd.exe
